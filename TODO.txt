Flexible Template Theme TODO
Things I'd like to add/improve:

- [General] Set better, more "sensible" default styles in _page.scss and the layout files
- [General] Set styles that work smoothly at all screen sizes, for all content
- [General] Add support for section icons that go above the header, for example like this (https://i.imgur.com/QpCxYes.png)
- [General] Allow button type to be selected (hollow, clear) and ideally color settings
- [General] Offer option to link a button to a form modal. There is an ACF plugin that does this for NinjaForms, but there is probably a better solution

- [Post Type Grid] Create a few post grid type "pre-built" templates that can be selected in the settings
  Ideas:
  -- Default that shows featured image as background, and when hovered changes to background color and post title
  -- A "card" made up of all text, heading/title has background color
  -- Heading visible with background color, on hover it shows the text content and/or image

- [ACF Frontend] Add a "clear selected" button for the color picker field
- [ACF Frontend] Find out if anything is confusing to use, or doesn't act as expected

- [Slider] Add fields to put headings/text beneath slider images (common for news/events/articles)
